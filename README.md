## Overview

The goal of the project was to implement a 2-dimensional tree data structure (k-d tree
implementation) and evaluate its performance of datasets of increasing size N. The nearest 
neighbor query search was tested, and its evaluated performance outperformed the brute force
approach on random data sets of size N. Additionally, an interactive GUI was implemented to
visualize the k-d trees spatial structure in a 2-d space.

## Required Software
This is project uses no external libraries. It runs with all the included libraries in Java.

## How to Run the Code
#### KD-Tree Unit Tests
To validate the correctness of the KD-tree implementation run the unit test file:
```
kdtree -> tests -> KDTreeTests                          
```

#### KD-Tree Performance Tests
The performance test results will print out the terminal window when run.
To run the performance test on the KD-tree structure locally run the test file:
```
kdtree -> tests -> TimeEval                          
```

#### KD-Tree Interactive GUI
To run the KD-tree interactive GUI run the following file:
```
kdtreeGUI -> KDViewer -> KDViewer                          
```
